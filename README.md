# RunData
A collection of code for gathering my running and sleep data and then analyzing it.  I use a Garmin Fenix watch, Whoop strap, and Oura ring.  The data itself is not in the repository since it is personal.  The goal is to make my code public to receive feedback on how to potentially make things better.
